## Non-commercial
I provide links to external articles, books, HOWTOs, courses etc for people to learn more about Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, git, github etc.


Where such links are to web sites are for commercial services: 
- I have no commercial affiliation whatsoever these web sites or the companies that run them
- I receive no commission, fees, or other fungible benefits from any of these web sites or the companies that run them

I will gladly accept links to similar Internet resources provided the following conditions are met:
* The links should be submitted as a pull request on this github repository
* The Links should not contain any tracking components in the URLs
* The links should not include any sales affiliation components that allows anyone to derive sales commissions, fees or other recognitions
* The pull request should clearly state the above

If a link is subsequently found to violate the above conditions, **I reserve the right to edit the URL and / or remove the links completely**.

I am not at all against commercial affiliations / sales commissions / fees or other types of recognitions. This repository is just not the place for them.

## Request for removal
If you are the owner of one of the sites listed, and you do not want a particular URL listed, open an issue indicating:
* Which specific URL you want removed
* Reason for removal
* Proof that you own the URL

I will be happy to remove URLs for any issues opened with valid information as indicated above.

## No recommendations
I do not specifically recommend any of the products or services or sites listed. 
I also do not specifically express any preferences of one link, service or product over another, except when I explicitly include my opinion from my own personal experience, annotated as such.

## No preference for retail web sites
In general I do not have a preference for any particular retail web site over another.
If the same product is listed on multiple web sites, I would **prefer** links to a web site 
that have a history of keeping links available even when the product in question is no
longer being sold by them. Amazon is **one example** of such a retail web site.
This does not mean I **prefer** Amazon links or accept only Amazon links
